WHAT IS POLOGEN?

	That awesome effect you have wanted on your website for so long.
	Feed pologen a few sets of folders full of images, and it will
  generate a nice collage of polorids for you using imagick.

CURRENT FEATURES:

 * Configurable coordinates and offsets.

 * Drop shadow and corner curl

 * Supports randomly pulling images from any number of folders

 * Ensures not to pull more than one photo from each category.

 * Outputs as flat jpg, or as a png with alpha transparency

NOTES

	You will need imagick installed to use this. Well worth it and well worth
	taking the time to experiment with this so you can learn it.

	imagick is magic
